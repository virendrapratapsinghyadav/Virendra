        "During my time at university, I was challenged to enhance the collaborative features within WhatsApp. After considering multiple solutions, Meetup for WhatsApp was born. This project aims to seamlessly integrate event planning functionality through Meetup. Rooted in extensive user research, persona development, and iterative design processes, Meetup seeks to address common pain points such as difficulty organising group plans and finding crucial information within chat threads. By adhering to WhatsApp's design guidelines and maintaining cohesion with its interface, I endeavoured to redefine the user experience, empowering individuals to effortlessly coordinate gatherings while enhancing the platform's utility and appeal.",
