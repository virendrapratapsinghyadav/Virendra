    context: 'During my time at university, I was challenged to enhance the collaborative features within WhatsApp. After considering multiple solutions, Meetup for WhatsApp was born. This project aims to seamlessly integrate event planning functionality through Meetup. Rooted in extensive user research, persona development, and iterative design processes, Meetup seeks to address common pain points such as difficulty organising group plans and finding crucial information within chat threads. By adhering to WhatsApp design guidelines and maintaining cohesion with its interface, I endeavoured to redefine the user experience, empowering individuals to effortlessly coordinate gatherings while enhancing the platforms utility and appeal.',
    outcome: 'Meetup introduces a seamless event planning feature within WhatsApp, enabling users to effortlessly organise gatherings, meetings, and events directly within their chat environment. By integrating collaborative functionality, such as scheduling and centralised event information management, Meetup addresses users frustrations with existing limitations, streamlining the planning process and enhancing communication efficiency.',

    context: 'Cheil is a digital agency owned by Samsung Group. During my time there as a graduate, I was on the conversion rate optimisation (CRO) team focusing on improving samsung.com/au. My role was user experience graduate where I would work closely with the team to research insights based on data, heuristic principles and competitors. With these insights, I would design modifications to the site, hand off designs to developers and then run an A/B test to determine if our hypothesise were accurate. During my time as a graduate, we designed and shipped approximately 35 different A/B tests; this case study will focus on 2 tests.',
    outcome: 'Throughout the entire process, we were constantly researching, designing and shipping A/B tests. Between the team of 3 UX designers, we would aim for about 12 insights per fortnight. These insights would then get workshopped, refined and approved to be presented to stakeholders. I personally, had the privilege of designing 12 tests that were approved by stakeholders which have either run, or are in the backlog to be run in the near future.',

    context: 'In early 2024, I was approached by a founder of a Saas product that was a game changer for online coaches, about a website refresh. His current site had a high bounce rate, looked outdated and was not optimised for conversion. Coachbase is a tool that online coaches can use to build meal plans for their clients rapidly. The founder wanted to promote 3 main benefits of this on the new site and ultimately foster more sign ups online.',
    outcome: 'I loved the challenge of this project as it allowed me to empathise with a new set of users and work closely with a passionate founder. This project ultimately ended in the design and development of the new Coachbase website. The overall result was positive as the new site has gone live, has already seen a conversion increase of 38% and accurately represents the benefits of having Coachbase in your corner.',

    context: `I'm a frontend developer with a focus on building modern, responsive, and accessible web applications. I primarily work with React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, and enjoy turning UI designs into functional interfaces. Currently, my GitHub consists mostly of frontend projects, ranging from simple interfaces to component-driven applications using React. Each project reflects my intent to improve user experience, follow best practices, and write clean, maintainable code. Iâ€™m also in the process of transitioning toward full-stack development. I'm actively learning Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with the goal of building complete MERN stack applications in the near future.`,
    outcome: `Through consistent practice and project-based learning, I've built a growing portfolio of frontend projects that demonstrate my understanding of modern web development.

My GitHub reflects:
Proficiency in React and component-driven design
Use of Tailwind CSS for fast and scalable UI styling
A solid foundation in vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation
An evolving path toward full-stack development (MERN)
In the coming months, you can expect to see backend integration, API development, and full-stack apps added to this repository. I'm also open to feedback, collaboration, and learning from the developer community.
Thanks for visiting!`
